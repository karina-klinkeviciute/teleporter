# Teleporter
We are building a teleporter here.

# How this idea came to life
With a friend we often would talk "I'm eating this delicious vegan icecream." "Oh, I would like some too" "I would gladly give you some if you were here". 
Or, like "I need a hug" "I'd hug you if I were there with you". 
Unfortunately we often would be quite far from each other, like in different cities or countries. It would involve ours or days of travelling. 
That's how we came up with this idea of building a teleporter so that we could travel to each other much faster and easier.

# A Plan
1. Figure out how to make a teleporter
2. Make a teleporter

# Current state
We are still trying to figure out how to create a teleporter. There is quite an abundance in literature about using them, but not so many about how to build one. 

# How you can contribute
Any sort of contribution is welcome. Even if you don't have any background in physics, electronics or spacetime management, you can still be of help. You can help with documentation or community support.
